# Barnacle Bot
A simple bot for Discord. Current fucntions include automatic pinning when the author of a message reacts with a pin (📌) emoji. The message can also be removed from pins using the X (❌) emoji; only the author of the pinned message is able to do this as well.

## Setup
For more setup instructions and a guide, please visit [An Idiot's Guide](https://anidiots.guide), not even going to lie here, this was cobbled together in an afternoon. As of this update the bot works, however don't be surprised if one day it doesn't.
